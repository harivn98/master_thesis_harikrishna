## 1. Executive Summary

This thesis introduces a **novel end-to-end pipeline** that chains three state-of-the-art vision foundation models—**SAM2** (Meta), **VideoPainter** (TencentARC/SIGGRAPH 2025), and **Alpamayo-R1-10B** (NVIDIA)—into a unified system for **generating synthetic lane markings in autonomous driving videos and quantitatively evaluating their impact on trajectory prediction**.

None of the three upstream repositories were designed to interoperate. Each was released as a standalone research artifact. This thesis contributes **10 novel technical ideas** that transform them into a cohesive, production-grade pipeline:

## 2. Upstream Repositories vs. Local Modifications

### 2.1 TencentARC/VideoPainter vs generation/VideoPainter

**Upstream** ([github.com/TencentARC/VideoPainter](https://github.com/TencentARC/VideoPainter)): SIGGRAPH 2025 paper — dual-stream video inpainting with CogVideoX-5B backbone and a lightweight context encoder. The repository provides:

| Directory | Upstream Purpose |
|-----------|-----------------|
| `app/` | Gradio demo application |
| `diffusers/` | Modified HuggingFace Diffusers (CogVideoX support) |
| `infer/` | Inference scripts (`edit_bench.py`, shell runners) |
| `train/` | Training scripts (CogVideoX fine-tuning) |
| `evaluate/` | LPIPS, temporal consistency, CLIP-based evaluation |
| `data_utils/` | VPData download and preprocessing |
| `env.sh`, `requirements.txt` | Environment setup |

**Local additions & modifications** (entirely novel files marked with ★):

| File/Directory | Status | Purpose |
|---------------|--------|---------|
| ★ `Dockerfile` | **New** (95 lines) | Full CUDA 12.1 container with Qwen VLM, Diffusers, workflow SDK, pre-cached eval models |
| ★ `docker-compose.yaml` | **New** | Container orchestration for local and cloud builds |
| ★ `workflow_vp.py` | **New** (1,620 lines) | Complete cloud workflow: GCS FUSE-mounted storage, multi-video discovery, VLM symlink management, output upload, prompt parsing, data staging |
| ★ `training_workflow.py` | **New** (300 lines) | FluxFill LoRA training cloud workflow: data download from GCS, training subprocess, checkpoint upload |
| ★ `workflow_sdk.whl` | **New** | Custom workflow SDK for cloud orchestration |
| ★ `data_1/` | **New** | Local test data (meta.csv, masks/, raw_videos/) |
| ★ `data_unprocessed/` | **New** | Intermediate processing data (frames/, segmentation_mask/) |
| ★ `ckpt/` | **New** | Checkpoint directories (CLIP ViT-L/14, CogVideoX-5b-I2V, SDXL inpaint) |
| `infer/edit_bench.py` | **Modified** | FluxFill pipeline integration, VLM refinement loop, multi-GPU orchestration, mask dilation/feathering |

| `diffusers/` | **Modified** | Bug fixes (missing `outputs.py`), custom patches for CogVideoX |

**Key architectural difference:** Upstream VideoPainter runs only CogVideoX for video inpainting. The local version introduces a **dual-model pipeline** (FluxFill → CogVideoX) where FluxFill generates a high-quality semantically-correct first frame, and CogVideoX propagates the edit temporally across all subsequent frames.

### 2.2 facebookresearch/sam2 vs segmentation/sam2

**Upstream** ([github.com/facebookresearch/sam2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2)): Meta's foundation model for promptable visual segmentation in images and videos. The repository provides:

| Directory | Upstream Purpose |

**Key architectural difference:** Upstream SAM2 is a general-purpose segmentation model with interactive point/box prompts. The local version adds an **automated road segmentation pipeline** that uses a fixed 6-point grid optimized for front-facing vehicle cameras, produces VideoPainter-compatible output formats, and includes complete GCS integration for cloud-scale processing.

---

### 2.3 NVlabs/alpamayo vs vla/alpamayo

**Upstream** ([github.com/NVlabs/alpamayo](https://github.com/NVlabs/alpamayo)): NVIDIA's Alpamayo-R1-10B Vision-Language-Action model for autonomous driving. The repository provides:

| Directory | Upstream Purpose |
|-----------|-----------------|
| `src/alpamayo_r1/` | Model code: VLA architecture, diffusion trajectory head, geometry, action space |
| `notebooks/` | Interactive inference notebook |
| `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock` | Dependency management (Python 3.12 + uv) |

Upstream's `test_inference.py` loads a single clip from NVIDIA's PhysicalAI-AV dataset and runs forward inference producing trajectory predictions. It has **no** support for processing edited videos, no batch processing, no visualization, and no evaluation metrics.

**Local additions (all novel):**

| File | Status | Purpose | Lines |
|------|--------|---------|-------|
| ★ `run_inference.py` | **New** | VP→Alpamayo bridge: filename parsing, frame replacement, dual-inference (original vs. generated), minADE computation, NPZ/JSON output, overlay+comparison video rendering | ~470 |
| ★ `workflow_alpamayo.py` | **New** | Cloud workflow: FUSE-mounted checkpoints + video data, batch video discovery, model loading once, per-video inference loop, GCS upload, aggregate reporting | 573 |
| ★ `visualize_video.py` | **New** | Trajectory rendering: pinhole projection, BEV inset, progressive reveal, camera-yaw-aware ego→cam transform, side-by-side comparison videos | ~530 |
| ★ `download_checkpoints.py` | **New** | Checkpoint download utility |
| ★ `Dockerfile` | **New** | Python 3.12, CUDA 12.1, flash-attn, physical_ai_av patch, workflow SDK | ~100 |
| ★ `docker-compose.yaml` | **New** | Container orchestration |
| ★ `README_DOCKER.md` | **New** | Docker-specific documentation |
| ★ `workflow_sdk.whl` | **New** | Cloud workflow SDK |
| ★ `checkpoints/` | **New** | Model checkpoint directory |
| ★ `npz/` | **New** | Visualization data archives |
| ★ `scripts/` | **New** | Build and run scripts |

**Key architectural difference:** Upstream Alpamayo runs inference on raw PhysicalAI-AV dataset clips. The local version creates a **VideoPainter-to-Alpamayo data bridge** that:
1. Parses clip_id and camera_name from VP output filenames
2. Loads the original clip's multi-camera frames + ego-motion from PhysicalAI-AV
3. Replaces exactly one camera's frames with VideoPainter-edited frames
4. Runs inference **twice** (original and generated) for A/B comparison
5. Computes minADE against ground-truth trajectories
6. Renders overlay and side-by-side comparison videos

## 3. Novel Contribution #1: Three-Stage Master Pipeline Orchestrator

### Problem
SAM2, VideoPainter, and Alpamayo each run in isolated environments with incompatible Python versions (3.10 vs 3.12), different GPU memory profiles, and no shared data interfaces. Running the full pipeline manually requires sequential Docker builds, GCS path management, and careful data handoffs.

### Solution
A **master workflow orchestrator** (`workflow_master.py`, 712 lines) that defines a DAG of three `@task` nodes, each running in its own container image, connected by data-dependency edges that enforce strict sequential execution:

```
SAM2 ──(run_id)──▶ VideoPainter ──(gcs_path)──▶ Alpamayo
```

### Technical Details

**Workflow Graph Architecture:**
- Each stage is a `@task` with its own `container_image`, GPU node allocation (A100 80GB), and cloud storage FUSE mounts
- The master orchestrator container is **lightweight** (Python 3.10-slim, ~200 MB) — it only serializes the workflow graph; heavy ML deps live in stage containers
- Data flows through GCS paths: Stage 1 writes to `gs://…/preprocessed_data_vp/<run_id>/`, Stage 2 reads from there and writes to `gs://…/vp/<run_id>/`, Stage 3 reads from there
- A single `run_id` propagates through all stages for end-to-end traceability

**Partial Workflow Support:** The orchestrator defines **7 workflow variants** for flexible execution:
| Workflow | Stages | Use Case |
|----------|--------|----------|
| `master_pipeline_wf` | 1→2→3 | Full pipeline |
| `sam2_only_wf` | 1 | Segmentation only |
| `sam2_vp_wf` | 1→2 | Segmentation + editing |
| `vp_only_wf` | 2 | Editing only (reuse SAM2 data) |
| `vp_alpamayo_wf` | 2→3 | Editing + evaluation |
| `alpamayo_only_wf` | 3 | Evaluation only (reuse VP data) |

**Build Script Intelligence** (`scripts/build_and_run.sh`, ~400 lines):
- `STAGES` variable selects which stages to run (e.g., `STAGES=12` runs SAM2→VP)
- Validates input dependencies (e.g., VP without SAM2 requires `SAM2_DATA_RUN_ID`)
- Builds only the Docker images needed for the selected stages
- Generates unique `MASTER_RUN_ID = RUN_ID_TIMESTAMP` for each execution
- Supports 5 pre-defined lane marking editing prompts, selectable via `PROMPT_IDS`
- Exports all configuration as environment variables for workflow serialization

**Why This Is Novel:** No prior work has chained a segmentation model, a video inpainting model, and a VLA trajectory model into a single orchestrated pipeline. The master orchestrator solves the container isolation problem while maintaining data lineage.

## 4. Novel Contribution #2: SAM2-Based Road Segmentation Pipeline

### Problem
SAM2 provides general-purpose segmentation with interactive prompts. Autonomous driving requires **automated road region detection** across thousands of videos without manual annotation.

### Solution
A complete road segmentation pipeline (`process_videos_sam2.py`, 1,118 lines) that uses SAM2's video predictor with a **fixed 6-point grid** optimized for front-facing vehicle camera geometry.

### Technical Details

#### Conceptual Design: Bottom-Half Point Strategy

The core insight behind this pipeline is that **front-facing autonomous driving cameras have a consistent spatial layout**: the road surface always occupies the lower portion of the frame, with the vanishing point near the vertical center. This geometric prior is exploited to eliminate the need for interactive prompts.

**Automatic Road Initialization (6-Point Grid — Bottom Half Only):**
```
All points are placed exclusively in the bottom half of the frame:

  ┌───────────────────────────────────┐
  │                                   │  ← Sky / buildings (ignored)
  │                                   │
  │           (0.50, 0.65)            │  ← Upper road boundary
  │      (0.35, 0.75) (0.65, 0.75)   │  ← Mid-road coverage
  │  (0.25, 0.80)       (0.75, 0.80) │  ← Wide road coverage
  │         (0.50, 0.85)              │  ← Center-bottom (reference)
  └───────────────────────────────────┘
```
These 6 normalized coordinates target the lower 65–85% of the frame where the road surface appears in dashcam footage. Each point is assigned `label=1` (foreground) to seed the SAM2 prompt. The bottom-center point `(0.50, 0.85)` is deliberately placed at the **most certain road location** — directly beneath the ego vehicle — and doubles as the **reference point** for connected-component filtering (see below).

**Why bottom-half only?** Placing points in the upper half would risk capturing sky, overpasses, or buildings as foreground. By constraining all seed points to the lower half, the prompt is guaranteed to hit road surface regardless of scene content, making the pipeline fully automatic across diverse driving environments (highway, urban, rural).

#### Four-Stage Mask Quality Pipeline

SAM2's raw output often contains artifacts: multiple disconnected segments (sidewalks, medians), small noise regions, and internal holes (from lane markings or shadows). A carefully designed four-stage morphological pipeline produces a **single, clean, hole-free road mask** suitable for video inpainting:

**Stage 1 — Morphological Opening (disconnect noise):**
```python
kernel = cv2.getStructuringElement(cv2.MORPH_ELLIPSE, (7, 7))
opened_mask = cv2.morphologyEx(mask_uint8, cv2.MORPH_OPEN, kernel)
```
Opening = erosion → dilation. This disconnects thin bridges between the road and adjacent regions (sidewalks, parking areas) that SAM2 sometimes merges, and removes small isolated noise blobs.

**Stage 2 — Connected-Component Filtering with Reference Point:**
```python
ref_point = (width // 2, int(height * 0.85))  # Bottom center
num_labels, labels, stats, centroids = cv2.connectedComponentsWithStats(opened_mask)
label_at_point = labels[ref_point[1], ref_point[0]]
if label_at_point > 0:
    filtered_mask = (labels == label_at_point)  # Keep ONLY the road
else:
    filtered_mask = largest_component            # Fallback: keep largest
```
The **reference point** at `(width/2, height×0.85)` — the bottom center of the frame — is the most geometrically certain road location in any front-facing dashcam view. After connected-component analysis, only the component that contains this reference point is retained. All other disconnected regions (sidewalks, medians, sky artifacts) are discarded. If the reference point falls on background (rare edge case), the largest component is kept as fallback.

**Stage 3 — Morphological Closing (merge small gaps):**
```python
kernel_close = cv2.getStructuringElement(cv2.MORPH_ELLIPSE, (9, 9))
filtered_mask = cv2.morphologyEx(filtered_mask, cv2.MORPH_CLOSE, kernel_close, iterations=2)
```
Closing = dilation → erosion. This fills narrow gaps within the road component — e.g., where lane markings, crosswalks, or shadows create thin breaks — without expanding the overall boundary.

**Stage 4 — Flood-Fill Hole Elimination:**
```python
def _fill_binary_mask_holes(mask_255):
    inv = cv2.bitwise_not(mask_255)           # Invert: background=255, road=0
    cv2.floodFill(inv, None, (0,0), 0)        # Erase external background
    holes = inv                                # Only internal holes remain as 255
    return cv2.bitwise_or(mask_255, holes)     # Fill holes back into road
```
Conceptual approach: After inversion, the external background (connected to frame borders) is flood-filled from corner (0,0) to zero. Any remaining 255 pixels in the inverted mask are **internal holes** (surrounded entirely by road). These are OR'd back into the original mask, producing a single continuous, hole-free road segment.

**Why hole-free masks matter for video inpainting:** VideoPainter's CogVideoX model treats the white mask region as the area to be regenerated. Internal holes (from lane markings, shadows, road patches) would cause the model to preserve those pixels unchanged while editing surrounding road — creating visible discontinuities. A single contiguous mask ensures the entire road surface is available for coherent lane marking generation.

```

#### Constant Frame Rate Strategy

Frames are extracted at a **fixed 8 FPS** via FFmpeg's fps filter — regardless of the source video's native frame rate (typically 20–30 fps):
```
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf fps=8 -vframes 100 output/%05d.jpg
```
This constant rate serves two purposes:
1. **Temporal consistency for SAM2:** Consistent inter-frame motion allows SAM2's memory bank to propagate masks reliably. Variable frame rates would cause inconsistent object displacement between frames.
2. **Direct compatibility with VideoPainter:** CogVideoX-5B expects uniformly-spaced input frames. By extracting at the same rate SAM2 processes, no re-sampling is needed between stages.

The output visualization and preprocessing videos are written at this same 8 FPS, preserving real-time duration alignment.

#### Processing Pipeline per Video

1. **Video Download:** GCS URI → local temp file via gcsfs (authenticated)
2. **Frame Extraction:** FFmpeg fps=8 filter, up to MAX_FRAMES (100 default), quality 2 JPEG
3. **FPS Detection:** Multi-method: ffprobe `avg_frame_rate` → `r_frame_rate` → OpenCV → fallback
4. **SAM2 Inference:** VOS-optimized video predictor with `apply_postprocessing=True`, temporal propagation across all frames from frame 0 seed points
5. **Parallel Mask Post-Processing:** ThreadPoolExecutor (up to 8 workers) applies the 4-stage morphological pipeline per frame in parallel (OpenCV releases the GIL)
6. **Multi-Format Output:**
   - Binary PNG masks per frame (0=keep, 255=inpaint)
   - Compressed NPZ archive (`all_masks.npz`) for efficient downstream loading
   - Visualization overlay videos (segmented regions highlighted in green)
   - Metadata CSV with video statistics and timing data
7. **VideoPainter-Compatible Preprocessing:** Creates the exact folder structure VP's `edit_bench.py` expects:
   ```
   preprocessed_data_vp/<run_id>/<video_id>/
     ├── meta.csv
     ├── masks/<video_id>/all_masks.npz
     └── raw_videos/<video_id>/<video_id>.0.mp4
   ```
8. **Parallel GCS Upload:** ThreadPoolExecutor (8 workers) uploads results and preprocessed data concurrently

#### Performance Optimizations in SAM2 Stage

| Optimization | Technique | Impact |
|-------------|-----------|--------|
| **Adaptive GPU precision** | bf16 + TF32 on Ampere+ GPUs; fp16 fallback on Turing (T4) | 1.5–2× faster inference |
| **VOS-optimized predictor** | `vos_optimized=True` in `build_sam2_video_predictor()` | Reduced memory footprint |
| **CUDA graph boundaries** | `torch.compiler.cudagraph_mark_step_begin()` before each video | Prevents tensor overwrite across videos |
| **In-memory mask pass-through** | Segmentation returns masks in memory; VP preprocessing reuses them directly, skipping disk re-read | Eliminates redundant I/O for 100+ masks per video |
| **Parallel post-processing** | ThreadPoolExecutor for morphological ops (OpenCV releases GIL → true parallelism) | Up to 8× speedup for mask pipeline |
| **Parallel GCS uploads** | 8-thread upload with pre-created remote directories | Saturates network bandwidth |
| **Thread-safe GCS singleton** | Double-checked locking for `gcsfs.GCSFileSystem` | Avoids per-call auth overhead |
| **Deterministic frame caching** | `_sync_frame_folder_to_max_frames()` reuses cached frames; trims surplus if MAX_FRAMES changes | Avoids re-extraction on reruns |
| **Aggressive memory cleanup** | Explicit `del processed_masks` + temp dir removal after each video | Keeps disk/RAM footprint bounded |

**Chunks:// URI Protocol:** A custom URI scheme for batch video selection:
```
chunks://bucket/prefix/camera_folder?start=0&end=10&per_chunk=5
```
Resolves to individual `gs://` paths by listing chunk directories (`chunk_0000/`, `chunk_0001/`, …) and selecting up to `per_chunk` MP4 files from each. Includes **early-stop optimization**: stops scanning GCS once enough files are collected for the requested slice.

**Why This Is Novel:** Prior road segmentation pipelines use specialized models (lane detectors, semantic segmentation). This is the first to repurpose SAM2 as an automated road segmentor specifically for generating video inpainting masks, using a bottom-half reference-point strategy with a four-stage morphological pipeline to produce single, hole-free road segments directly compatible with VideoPainter's expected input format.

## 5. Novel Contribution #3: FluxFill Integration into VideoPainter's Edit Pipeline

### Problem
VideoPainter's original `edit_bench.py` generates all frames using only CogVideoX-5B. The first frame often lacks semantic precision for fine-grained lane marking attributes (single vs. double, white vs. yellow, solid vs. dashed) because CogVideoX optimizes for temporal consistency rather than per-frame detail.

### Solution
A **dual-model pipeline** where FluxFill generates a semantically-precise first frame, and CogVideoX propagates the edit temporally:

```
Input Video + Mask
       │
       ▼
   FluxFill → High-quality first frame (image inpainting)
       │
       ▼
   CogVideoX → Temporally consistent video (video diffusion)
       │
       ▼
   Edited Video
```

### Technical Details

**Modified File:** `infer/edit_bench.py`

**FluxFillPipeline Integration:**
- Loads `FluxFillPipeline` from a local checkpoint or GCS-mounted path
- Supports optional LoRA weights (`--img_inpainting_lora_path`, `--img_inpainting_lora_scale`)
- First frame is generated at the video's native resolution
- Mask is applied with configurable dilation and Gaussian feathering

**Mask Processing Pipeline:**
- `_dilate_and_feather_mask_images()`: Expands inpaint regions using morphological dilation (configurable `dilate_size`, default 24px), then applies Gaussian blur for smooth boundaries (configurable `mask_feather`, default 8px)
- `--keep_masked_pixels` flag: When enabled, preserves the original background pixels outside the mask in the final composite, preventing FluxFill from altering non-road regions

**Multi-GPU Orchestration & Memory Management:**
- Qwen VLM on `cuda:1` (when available, controlled by `VP_QWEN_DEVICE`)
- FluxFill + CogVideoX on `cuda:0` (controlled by `VP_FLUX_DEVICE`, `VP_COG_DEVICE`)
- `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True` for dynamic memory management

**Staged Model Loading/Unloading (VRAM Budgeting):**
CogVideoX-5B alone requires ~35 GiB VRAM. To fit all models on a single A100 80GB:
1. **Load Qwen VLM first** → generate captions / run refinement loop
2. **Unload Qwen** (`_unload_qwen_model()`: delete model refs → `gc.collect()` → `torch.cuda.empty_cache()`) to reclaim ~14 GiB
3. **Load FluxFill** → generate first frame
4. **Unload FluxFill** → reclaim ~24 GiB
5. **Load CogVideoX** → propagate edit temporally

This sequential load/unload pattern ensures peak VRAM never exceeds ~40 GiB, allowing all three models to run on a single GPU.

**Qwen VLM VRAM Budgeting:**
```python
total_gib = torch.cuda.get_device_properties(target).total_memory / (1024³)
reserve_gib = int(os.environ.get("QWEN_VRAM_RESERVE_GIB", "12"))
budget_gib = max(8, min(total_gib - reserve_gib, int(total_gib * 0.9)))
max_memory = {target: f"{budget_gib}GiB", "cpu": "192GiB"}
# Prevent spilling onto the Flux/Cog GPU:
for i in range(gpu_count):
    if i != target:
        max_memory[i] = "1GiB"
```

**Why This Is Novel:** No prior work has combined a still-image inpainting model (FluxFill) with a video diffusion model (CogVideoX) in a sequential first-frame → temporal-propagation pipeline for video editing, with staged model loading to fit all three large models (Qwen 7B + FluxFill 12B + CogVideoX 5B) on a single GPU.

## 6. Novel Contribution #4: VLM-Guided Iterative Caption Refinement

### Problem
Text-guided inpainting is highly sensitive to prompt quality. Generic prompts like "white lane marking" produce inconsistent results. The model needs specific visual texture details, but manually crafting prompts per video is infeasible at scale.

### Solution
An **automated QA loop** using Qwen2.5-VL (7B) that evaluates FluxFill's output and iteratively refines the caption until the generated image matches the editing instruction.

### Technical Details

**Function:** `_qwen_refine_first_frame_caption()` in `infer/edit_bench.py`

**Refinement Loop (up to N iterations, default 10):**
1. FluxFill generates a first frame using the current caption
2. Qwen2.5-VL receives: `[original_frame, generated_frame, editing_instruction]`
3. VLM evaluates semantic correctness:
   - Lane marking count (single vs. double)
   - Color accuracy (white vs. yellow)
   - Pattern type (solid vs. dashed)
   - Perspective alignment with original lanes
   - Road texture preservation
4. VLM outputs: `PASS` or `FAIL` with structured reasoning
5. On `FAIL`: VLM generates a revised caption with more specific visual details
6. Loop continues until `PASS` or max iterations reached

**Configurable Parameters:**
- `--caption_refine_iters` (default: 10): Maximum refinement iterations
- `--caption_refine_temperature` (default: 0.1): VLM sampling temperature (low = deterministic)
- `VP_UNLOAD_QWEN_AFTER_USE=1`: Unload VLM after refinement to free VRAM for CogVideoX

**Why This Is Novel:** This is the first use of a VLM as an automated quality assessor in a video inpainting loop. The feedback mechanism creates a closed-loop system where the editing model's output quality is verified against the semantic intent before temporal propagation.

## 7. Novel Contribution #5: Automated FluxFill Training Data Generation

### Problem
Training a specialized FluxFill LoRA for lane markings requires thousands of (image, mask, caption) triplets. Manually annotating road images with masks and lane-attribute captions is prohibitively expensive.

### Solution
A fully automated pipeline (`data_generation.py`, 1,112 lines) that generates training datasets from raw autonomous driving videos using SAM2 + Qwen2.5-VL.

### Technical Details

**Pipeline Stages:**
1. **GCS Video Discovery:** Lists MP4 files in chunk-structured GCS folders, selectable by slice
2. **Frame Extraction:** FFmpeg-based extraction of specific frame numbers per video
3. **SAM2 Mask Generation:** Image predictor mode with road-optimized point grid → binary masks
4. **VLM Caption Generation (Qwen2.5-VL-7B):**
   - Receives the frame image as input
   - Extracts structured lane attributes:
     - **Count:** single / double / unknown
     - **Color:** white / yellow / mixed / unknown
     - **Pattern:** solid / dashed / mixed / unknown
   - Generates normalized prompt: `"road with {count} {color} {pattern} lane markings"`
5. **Dataset Assembly:**
   ```
   dataset_folder/
     ├── train.csv       (image, mask, prompt, prompt_2)
     ├── images/*.png    (original frames)
     └── masks/*.png     (binary road masks)
   ```
6. **GCS Upload:** Complete dataset uploaded to GCS for training

**Scale:** Successfully generated 10,000+ training samples from NVIDIA PhysicalAI-AV data.

**Performance Optimizations:**

| Optimization | Before | After | Impact |
|-------------|--------|-------|--------|
| **Model caching** | Each worker reloaded Qwen (~2 min × 8 workers) | Per-device singleton: `_qwen_models[device]` → loaded once per GPU | 16 min → 2 min startup |
| **Threading over multiprocessing** | `multiprocessing.Pool` → 8 separate model copies (8 × 7 GiB = 56 GiB) | `ThreadPool` → shared memory, models loaded once | ~7× memory reduction |
| **Model pre-loading** | Models loaded on first use (race conditions) | `_preload_models_on_gpus()` loads SAM2 + Qwen on all GPUs in parallel at startup | Predictable startup, no races |
| **Multi-GPU separation** | SAM2 and Qwen competed for cuda:0 | SAM2 on cuda:0, Qwen biased to cuda:1 with explicit VRAM budgeting | No OOM conflicts |
| **Early-stop GCS listing** | Scanned entire GCS prefix | `if len(all_paths) >= needed: break` | Orders of magnitude faster for large prefixes |

**Why This Is Novel:** This is the first automated pipeline that combines a segmentation model (SAM2) with a vision-language model (Qwen2.5-VL) to generate structured training data for inpainting models, with semantically-parsed lane marking attributes.

---

## 8. Novel Contribution #6: Semantic Lane-Attribute Dataset Filtering

### Problem
Raw generated datasets contain mixed lane attributes. Training a LoRA for "single white solid" lane markings requires filtering out all other combinations.

### Solution
A multi-attribute filtering system (`filter_fluxfill_dataset.py`, 725 lines) with regex-based prompt parsing and configurable quality controls.

### Technical Details

**Attribute Parsing (Regex):**
```python
r"road with (?P<count>...) (?P<color>...) (?P<pattern>...) lane markings"
```
Extracts `count`, `color`, `pattern` from normalized captions produced by `data_generation.py`.

**Filtering Modes:**
| Parameter | Values | Effect |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| `count` | single / double / any | Filter by lane count |
| `color` | white / yellow / mixed / any | Filter by lane color |
| `pattern` | solid / dashed / mixed / any | Filter by lane pattern |
| `REQUIRE_CLEAR_ROAD` | 0 / 1 | Reject prompts with "unknown" attributes |

**Copy Modes:** `copy` / `hardlink` / `symlink` (GCS always uses copy)

**GCS Support:** Both input and output can be GCS paths. Local staging is used for filtering, then batch upload.

**Why This Is Novel:** First semantic curation tool for lane marking datasets that filters by structured visual attributes extracted from VLM captions.

## 9. Novel Contribution #7: FluxFill LoRA Fine-Tuning Pipeline

### Problem
The base FluxFill model generates generic inpainting. Lane markings require specific visual patterns (dashed spacing, line thickness, color fidelity) that the base model doesn't produce reliably.

### Solution
A complete LoRA fine-tuning pipeline (`training_workflow.py` + `train/train_fluxfill_inpaint_lora.py`) that trains FluxFill on curated lane-marking datasets.

### Technical Details

**Training Configuration:**
| Parameter | Default | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `rank` | 16 | LoRA rank |
| `lora_alpha` | 16 | LoRA scaling factor |
| `learning_rate` | 1e-5 | AdamW optimizer LR |
| `lr_scheduler` | cosine | Learning rate schedule |
| `lr_warmup_steps` | 50 | Warmup steps |
| `num_train_epochs` | 5 | Training epochs |
| `train_batch_size` | 1 | Per-GPU batch size |
| `gradient_accumulation_steps` | 1 | Effective batch multiplier |
| `mixed_precision` | bf16 | Mixed precision training |
| `checkpointing_steps` | 100 | Save frequency |

**Cloud Workflow Integration:**
- Cloud storage FUSE mounts for FluxFill base checkpoint (`ckpt/flux_inp`)
- Training data downloaded from GCS to local scratch
- Output checkpoints uploaded to GCS with timestamp-based run IDs
- A100 80GB GPU allocation

**Multi-Dataset Training — 5 Specialized LoRA Checkpoints:**

The pipeline supports training **5 independent LoRA checkpoints** in parallel, one per lane-marking combination.  This is driven by `scripts/build_and_run_training_all.sh`, which iterates over the 5 filtered datasets produced by `build_and_run_sorting_data.sh` and submits a separate HLX training workflow for each:

| # | Dataset (Input) | Checkpoint (Output) | Lane Type |
|---|----------------|---------------------|-----------|
| 1 | `td-chunk0-99_single_white_solid/` | `fluxfill_single_white_solid_<TS>/` | Single solid white |
| 2 | `td-chunk0-99_double_white_solid/` | `fluxfill_double_white_solid_<TS>/` | Double solid white |
| 3 | `td-chunk0-99_single_yellow_solid/` | `fluxfill_single_yellow_solid_<TS>/` | Single solid yellow |
| 4 | `td-chunk0-99_double_yellow_solid/` | `fluxfill_double_yellow_solid_<TS>/` | Double solid yellow |
| 5 | `td-chunk0-99_single_white_dashed/` | `fluxfill_single_white_dashed_<TS>/` | Single dashed white |

**End-to-end flow:**
```
data_generation.py          → td-chunk0-99/                  (raw training triplets)
filter_fluxfill_dataset.py  → td-chunk0-99_<lane_type>/      (5 filtered subsets)
training_workflow.py        → fluxfill_<lane_type>_<TS>/      (5 LoRA checkpoints)
```

**Usage:**
```bash
# Step 1: Generate training data (chunks 0–99)
bash segmentation/sam2/scripts/build_and_run_training_data.sh 0 99

# Step 2: Sort into 5 lane-type datasets
bash segmentation/sam2/scripts/build_and_run_sorting_data.sh 0 99

# Step 3: Train 5 LoRA checkpoints (one per lane type)
bash generation/VideoPainter/scripts/build_and_run_training_all.sh 0 99

# Step 4: Use a specific checkpoint for inference
TRAINED_FLUXFILL_GCS_PATH="workspace/user/hbaskar/.../fluxfill_single_white_solid_<TS>" \
  STAGES=2 bash scripts/build_and_run.sh
```

Each checkpoint is stored independently, allowing selective deployment during inference.  The master pipeline's `TRAINED_FLUXFILL_GCS_PATH` variable points at the desired checkpoint.

**Training Results (Run: 20260222_201003):**

All 5 jobs executed in parallel on separate A100 80GB GKE nodes. Identical hyperparameters: rank=16, alpha=16, lr=1e-5, cosine schedule, 50 warmup steps, 5 epochs, batch=1, grad_accum=4, seed=42. Training speed: ~6.8s/step.

| # | Lane Type | Images | Steps | Time | Epoch Avg Losses (1→5) | Status |
|---|-----------|--------|-------|------|----------------------|--------|
| 1 | `single_yellow_solid` | 372 | 465 | 59.1 min | 0.1701 → 0.1761 → 0.1682 → 0.1855 → **0.1652** | ✅ Complete |
| 2 | `single_white_dashed` | 373 | 470 | 59.0 min | 0.1475 → 0.1577 → 0.1486 → 0.1706 → **0.1455** | ✅ Complete |
| 3 | `single_white_solid` | 1,522 | 1,905 | 3.68 hrs | 0.1670 → 0.1586 → 0.1654 → 0.1692 → **0.1690** | ✅ Complete |
| 4 | `double_white_solid` | 4,612 | 5,765 | 10.98 hrs | 0.1724 → 0.1735 → 0.1701 → 0.1712 → **0.1672** | ✅ Complete |
| 5 | `double_yellow_solid` | 6,493 | 8,120 | 15.43 hrs | 0.1644 → 0.1589 → 0.1593 → 0.1577 → **0.1570** | ✅ Complete |

Key observations:
- Loss stabilizes by epoch 3 for all jobs (final-epoch avg range: 0.145–0.169)
- All 5 jobs complete. The largest dataset (double_yellow_solid, 6,493 images) converged to 0.157; the smallest (single_yellow_solid, 372 images) to 0.165 — all within a narrow band, confirming scalability
- Epoch duration scales linearly with dataset size: ~59 min for 370-image datasets, ~3.7 hrs for 1,522-image, ~11 hrs for 4,612-image, ~15.4 hrs for 6,493-image datasets (~6.8s/step consistent)
- GCS upload of final checkpoints completes quickly: ~8s for smaller jobs, ~1.6 min for double_white_solid (57 checkpoints)
- GCS data download scales linearly: ~3 min for 1.5k images, ~9.1 min for 4.6k images
- Harmless `gcsfs`/`aiohttp` session cleanup traceback at exit does not affect results

**Why This Is Novel:** First LoRA fine-tuning pipeline specifically designed for FluxFill inpainting on structured lane marking datasets, with automated multi-variant training producing one specialized checkpoint per lane-marking type, integrated into a cloud workflow system.

## 10. Novel Contribution #8: Alpamayo VLA Trajectory Evaluation

### Problem
Video inpainting quality is traditionally measured by pixel-level metrics (LPIPS, SSIM, FID). These metrics don't capture whether the edited lane markings would actually affect autonomous driving behavior.

### Solution
Use NVIDIA's Alpamayo-R1-10B VLA model to **predict driving trajectories on both original and inpainted videos**, then measure the trajectory divergence via minADE.

### Technical Details

**VideoPainter → Alpamayo Data Bridge** (`run_inference.py`):

1. **Filename Parsing:** Extracts `clip_id` and `camera_name` from VP output filenames:
   ```
   <clip_id>.<camera_name>_vp_edit_sample0_generated.mp4
   ```

2. **Original Data Loading:** Uses `load_physical_aiavdataset()` to retrieve:
   - Multi-camera frames (7 views: front_wide, front_tele, cross_left/right, rear_left/right, rear_tele)
   - Ego-motion history (16 timesteps at CONTENT_TIME_STEP)
   - Ground-truth future trajectory (64 waypoints at 10 Hz, 6.4s horizon)

3. **Temporal Alignment:**
   - VP video encoded at 8 fps → `CONTENT_TIME_STEP = 0.125s`
   - `t0_us = (total_frames − 1) × 0.125s × 1e6` for dataset alignment
   - Last 4 consecutive frames per camera used for inference

4. **Dual Inference** (with `black_non_target_cameras=true`):
   - **Original inference:** Run Alpamayo on unmodified dataset frames → `original_min_ade`
   - **Frame replacement:** Substitute one camera's last-4-frames with VP output (with bilinear resize if needed)
   - **Generated inference:** Run Alpamayo on modified frames → `min_ade_meters`
   - Both share identical ego-motion history and all other camera views
   - Non-target cameras are blacked out (zeroed), isolating the effect of the edited front camera on trajectory prediction

5. **minADE Computation:**
   $$\text{minADE} = \min_{s \in S} \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \| \hat{p}_{xy}^{(s)}(t) - p_{xy}^{gt}(t) \|_2$$
   where $S$ = trajectory samples, $T$ = 64 waypoints, XY-plane only.

6. **Chain-of-Thought Extraction:** Both original and generated inference produce reasoning traces from the VLA model's language head.

**Output Artifacts per Video:**
| File | Format | Content |
|------|--------|---------|
| `*_inference.json` | JSON | Predictions, minADE (both original & generated), reasoning traces, temporal config, metrics |
| `*_vis_data.npz` | NPZ | Trajectory tensors, image frames, camera indices, full original camera frames |
| `*_overlay.mp4` | H.264 | Trajectory overlay on generated video |
| `*_comparison.mp4` | H.264 | Side-by-side original vs. generated with trajectories |

**Why This Is Novel:** This is the **first use of a VLA model as an evaluation metric for video inpainting**. By comparing trajectory predictions on original vs. edited videos, we obtain a functionally meaningful measure of inpainting quality that goes beyond pixel-level metrics.

**Experimental Results (Run 006 — 100 videos × 5 prompts × 2 variants = 1,000 experiments, `black_non_target_cameras=true`):**

Alpamayo Run IDs: `06_p{1-5}_gen_video_20260222_*` (100frames) and `06_p{1-5}_gen_vps90_video_20260222_*` (vps90).

Baseline (original unedited videos): mean minADE = 3.778 m, median = 2.646 m.

| Prompt | Lane Type | minADE (100fr) | Δ from Baseline | Improved/Degraded |
|--------|-----------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| p1 | Single white solid | 3.842 m | +0.063 m | 47% / 53% |
| p2 | Double white solid | 3.995 m | +0.217 m | 47% / 53% |
| p3 | Single yellow solid | 3.895 m | +0.117 m | **52%** / 48% |
| p4 | Double yellow solid | 3.917 m | +0.139 m | 46% / 54% |
| p5 | Single white dashed | 4.065 m | +0.286 m | 40% / **60%** |

Key findings:
- **p3 (single yellow solid)** achieves the highest improvement rate (52%) — the only prompt where more videos improved than degraded
- **p5 (dashed white)** performs worst (40% improvement, +0.286 m Δ), correlated with 50% caption refinement failure rate
- When editing helps, the average improvement is substantial (−0.9 m); when it hurts, degradation averages +1.1 m
- vps90 variant performs marginally worse than 100frames (44.4% vs 46.4% improvement rate)
- These results use base FluxFill without LoRA and `black_non_target_cameras=true` (non-target cameras blacked out); trained LoRA checkpoints are expected to improve results

---

## 11. Novel Contribution #9: Trajectory Visualization & Comparison Rendering

### Problem
Raw trajectory predictions (numpy arrays of 3D waypoints) are not interpretable without visualization. Comparing original vs. edited video trajectories requires careful frame-by-frame alignment.

### Solution
A comprehensive visualization system (`visualize_video.py`, ~530 lines) that renders:
1. **Trajectory overlay videos** with projected 3D waypoints on camera frames
2. **Side-by-side comparison videos** showing original and generated frames with their respective trajectories

### Technical Details

**3D → 2D Projection (Pinhole Camera Model):**
```
Ego frame:   x=forward, y=left, z=up
Camera frame: x=right, y=down, z=forward (depth)

Transform: x_cam = −y_ego, y_cam = −z_ego, z_cam = x_ego
```

**Camera-Yaw-Aware Transform:** For non-front cameras, the ego-to-camera transform includes a yaw rotation:
```python
CAMERA_YAW_RAD = {
    "camera_front_wide_120fov": 0.0,
    "camera_cross_left_120fov": π/2,
    "camera_cross_right_120fov": −π/2,
    "camera_rear_tele_30fov": π,
    ...
}
```

**Focal Length:** $f_x = \frac{W}{2 \cdot \tan(\text{FOV}/2)}$, with FOV auto-detected from camera name (120°, 70°, 30°).

**Visualization Features:**
- Progressive reveal mode: linearly maps frame index to waypoint count
- BEV inset (250×250 px) at bottom-left: ego history (gray), GT (red), predictions (cyan)
- 5 cycling colors for multiple trajectory samples
- Semi-transparent legend box
- HUD overlay with minADE, clip_id, camera info
- Points behind camera (z_cam ≤ 0.5m) filtered out

**Comparison Video Layout:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Original (left) │ Generated (right) │
│  + GT trajectory│  + pred trajectory│
│  + orig pred    │  + VP frames      │
│  BEV inset      │  BEV inset        │
│  Original minADE│  Generated minADE │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why This Is Novel:** First trajectory visualization system that renders projected 3D driving trajectories on both original and inpainted video frames for visual comparison of VLA model behavior changes.

## 12. Novel Contribution #10: Cloud-Native Containerized ML Infrastructure

### Problem
Three models with incompatible dependencies (Python 3.10 vs 3.12, different PyTorch versions, flash-attn only for Alpamayo) cannot share a single environment. Cloud-scale processing requires reproducible, isolated environments.

### Solution
Four purpose-built Docker containers orchestrated through cloud workflows with GCS FUSE-mounted data volumes.

### Container Architecture

| Container | Base Image | Python | Key Dependencies | Size |
|-----------|-----------|--------|-----------------|------|
| SAM2 | `nvidia/cuda:12.1.1-cudnn8-runtime-ubuntu22.04` | 3.10 | SAM2, Qwen2.5-VL, gcsfs, Workflow SDK | ~8 GB |
| VideoPainter | `nvidia/cuda:12.1.1-cudnn8-devel-ubuntu22.04` | 3.10 | CogVideoX, FluxFill, Diffusers, Qwen, Workflow SDK | ~15 GB |
| Alpamayo | `nvidia/cuda:12.1.1-cudnn8-devel-ubuntu22.04` | 3.12 | Alpamayo-R1, flash-attn, physical_ai_av, Workflow SDK | ~12 GB |
| Master | `python:3.10-slim` | 3.10 | Workflow SDK, gcsfs (lightweight orchestrator) | ~500 MB |

**Alpamayo Dockerfile Patch:**
```dockerfile
# physical_ai_av returns read-only Arrow-backed arrays; scipy needs writable buffers
RUN sed -i 's/\.to_numpy())/\.to_numpy().copy())/' \
    /usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages/physical_ai_av/egomotion.py
```

**GCS Data Architecture:**
```

```

**Cloud Storage FUSE Mounts (zero-copy model access):**
- Checkpoints mounted read-only via FUSE → no download latency
- Symlinks redirect container-expected paths to mount points
- Metadata prefetching warms the FUSE cache before inference

### Cross-Pipeline Performance Optimization Summary

The following table consolidates all performance optimizations applied across the three pipeline stages:

| Category | Optimization | Stage | Technique |
|----------|-------------|-------|----------|
| **GPU Precision** | Adaptive bf16/TF32 vs fp16 | SAM2 | Auto-detect Ampere+ (≥8.0) → bf16+TF32; Turing → fp16 |
| **GPU Precision** | Expandable CUDA segments | VP | `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True` |
| **GPU Memory** | Staged model loading/unloading | VP | Sequential Qwen → FluxFill → CogVideoX with explicit `del` + `empty_cache()` between stages |
| **GPU Memory** | Per-device VRAM budgeting | VP, Data Gen | Dynamic `max_memory` dict prevents cross-GPU spilling |
| **GPU Memory** | CUDA graph step boundaries | SAM2 | `cudagraph_mark_step_begin()` prevents tensor overwrite across videos |
| **Parallelism** | Threaded mask post-processing | SAM2 | ThreadPoolExecutor (8 workers); OpenCV releases GIL → true parallelism |
| **Parallelism** | Threaded GCS uploads | SAM2, Data Gen | 8-thread upload with pre-created remote directories |
| **Parallelism** | Threading over multiprocessing | Data Gen | `ThreadPool` shares model memory (7× reduction vs `multiprocessing.Pool`) |
| **Caching** | Thread-safe GCS singleton | SAM2, Data Gen | Double-checked locking avoids per-call auth overhead |
| **Caching** | Per-device model singletons | VP, Data Gen | `_qwen_models[device]` reuses loaded models across calls |
| **Caching** | Deterministic frame folder sync | SAM2 | Reuses cached frames; trims surplus if MAX_FRAMES changes |
| **Memory** | In-memory mask pass-through | SAM2 | Segmentation → VP preprocessing without disk round-trip |
| **Memory** | Aggressive temp cleanup | SAM2 | `del masks` + `shutil.rmtree()` after each video |
| **Memory** | Model pre-loading at startup | Data Gen | Parallel GPU model loading before processing begins |
| **I/O** | Early-stop GCS listing | SAM2, Data Gen | Stop scanning once enough files collected for requested slice |
| **I/O** | Compressed NPZ archives | SAM2 | `np.savez_compressed` for mask storage (10–50× smaller than PNGs) |
| **I/O** | Single-model batch inference | Alpamayo | Load Alpamayo-R1-10B once, run inference on all videos sequentially |
| **Quality** | VOS-optimized predictor | SAM2 | `vos_optimized=True` reduces memory while maintaining temporal consistency |
| **Quality** | 4-stage morphological pipeline | SAM2 | Open → connected-component → close → flood-fill produces hole-free masks |
